# font3x3
This is a 3x3 font. It's about as small as you can get,  
and it isn't really even readable. But if you need a quick  
font for a LED matrix, this should work.  

It contains uppercase A-Z (access them as lowercase) and a few  
symbols. It's written in the same format as https://github.com/petabyt/font/.  

I designed this for use on the ScrollBit, but never got around to  
using it for anything interesting. Feel free to use for whatever.
